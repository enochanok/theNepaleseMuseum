        <p>
            The Narayanhiti Palace Museum in Kathmandu, Nepal is a public museum situated east of the Kaiser Mahal and
            next to Thamel. The museum was established in 2008, after the 2006 revolution, from the complex of the
            former Narayanhiti Palace (Narayanhiti Durbar).

            Prior to the revolt, the palace was the Kingdom of Nepal's monarch's residence and principal place of
            function, and hosted state occasions. Constructed by King Mahendra in 1963, the current palace complex
            contains an extensive collection of courtyards, parks, and houses.
        </p>
        <h4 class="para-title">Why the name Narayanhiti Durbar ?</h4>
        <p>
            The name "Narayanhiti" consists of two 'Narayana' and 'Hiti' phrases. Narayan is Vishnu, the Hindu god whose
            temple is opposite the 'Hiti' means 'river spout' in Newar Language, which is to the east of the main gate
            in the palace precincts, a landmark that figures prominently in the local legends.

        <h4 class="para-title">History of Narayanhiti Durbar</h4>
        <p>
            The royal palace is known to have been the home to several former kings and queens.

            Early Residences

            Ownership of the location of the palace changed many times before royalty inhabited it. During the early
            Shah era, the Shreepali Basnet family occupied the site.

            Ownership passed to Premier Fateh Jung Shah after Dhokal Singh Basnyat; his aunt, Choutaria Pran Shah, also
            lived in the house.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>

            On 19 September 1846, Fateh was killed in the Kot massacre, and his family were expelled
            or banished from Kathmandu. Colonel Ranodip Singh Kunwar, Jung Bahadur Rana's brother, took over the
            property and palace, moving into Choutaria 's residence after limited renovations.

            The building was restored after Ranodip became prime minister in 1877, and enlarged into a luxurious
            multi-wing palace.

            Ranodip was murdered in the southern wing of the palace after the coup d'état on 22 November 1885.

        <h3 class="para-title">Royal Residence</h3>

        <p>
            Bir Shumsher Jang Bahadur replaced Ranodip Rana as Prime Minister and took over the palace. Bir Shumsher
            ordered the demolishing of the old palace in 1886, and a new one designed by the architect Jogbir Sthapit as
            a residence for his son-in-law, King Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah.

            That relocated the Hanuman Dhoka Durbar royal residence to Narayanhiti.In the Nepal – Bihar earthquake of
            1934, the palace was damaged, killing King Tribhuvan's two infant daughters.

            Colonel Surya Jung Thapa, an architect, was responsible for overseeing maintenance and improvements that
            added a new entrance and grand staircase.

            In 1963, King Mahendra ordered the destruction of the palace and its reconstruction. The new palace was
            designed by the Indian-born American architect Benjamin Polk.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Nepalese types of architecture were used to create a national symbol. However, the building ceased in
            1969. On 27 February 1970 Griha Pravesh (a housewarming party) was performed for Crown Prince Birendra's
            wedding.

            In 1972, Mahendra sold the palace for NPR some seventy million (seven crores) to the Government of Nepal. He
            claimed the estate was the dowry of his paternal grandmother Queen Divyeshwari.

            Crown Prince Dipendra assassinated numerous members of the royal family in the palace on 1 June 2001, before
            killing himself. King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya were amongst those killed.
